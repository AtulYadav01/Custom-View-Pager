# Custom-View-Pager

This is a custom view pager for Android Projects to stop scrolling behaviour of View Pagers.

You can add this viewpager into your project then go to your XML file and use this custom view pager instead of default ones.

In your activity.kt file reference it as CustomViewPager instead of ViewPager and the scrolling behaviour of your ViewPAger will stop.
